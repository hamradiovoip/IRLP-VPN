# IRLP-VPN
OpenVPN Server and firewall setup for IRLP nodes

Setting up OpenVPN for IRLP on a Budget VPS Server

Here are some steps I took to install the openvpn server software on an inexpensive virtual server. One needs some basic Linux skills to download, setup and run scripts to install openVPN as a server and client. I used Ubuntu 14 and 15 since The firewall would not work on Centos.
